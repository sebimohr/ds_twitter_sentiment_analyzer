# Twitter Sentiment Analyzer

This project will be submitted for the Wintersemester 2022 class 'Applied Data Science in Python'. 

The goal of the project is to retrieve tweets for different events from Twitter, to analyze them and to show the sentiment of each tweet. Also the user should have some kind of UI, where they can see the top Tweeters and Hashtags and interact with them.
